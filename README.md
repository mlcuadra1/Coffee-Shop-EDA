## Dataset

The dataset originally came from the [Coffee Shop Sales](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground) from Maven Analytics (License: Public Domain). I first found it from this [kaggle.com website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedabbas757/coffee-sales).

## Introduction

Welcome! This exploratory data analysis (EDA) marks my first engagement in the world of data science. As a beginner, selecting my first dataset was difficult, but in the end, my interest with cafe culture led me here. While not exactly the biggest fan of coffee (drinking it makes me drowsy), I've always appreciated its atmosphere during intense learning sessions. 

I've received invaluable advice to begin with EDA before delving into machine learning, an advice I'm happy to take. While incorporation of ML techniques remains a possible addition to this project, for now, allow me to share the discoveries I made!

## Objectives

The main objective of this project (so far) is: 

> **To perform EDA on sales data to develop insights about the coffee shop business.**

To achieve this objective, I broke it down to 5 smaller objectives:

1. To perform basic time-series analyses of in terms of daily and monthly sales and purchases;
2. To dig deeper by looking into the average daily sales-per-transaction over a month, average daily sales over a week, and average hourly sales in a day;
3. To show the distributions of products in terms of quantity sold and unit prices;
4. To observe the distributions purchase volume and drink sizes; and
5. To compare and contrast the product category purchases among the different store locations.

## Main Insights

From the exploratory data analysis, we found out the following trends from the business:

* The coffee shop business is continuously growing over the 6-month period.
* Hours 8 to 10 are the busiest ordering times at the cafe.
* Coffee and tea collectively contribute to 74% of the total income, whereas items not intended for immediate consumption constitute only 2% of the overall revenue.
* Transactions typically involve 1-2 purchases, where drinks in particular are in Regular or Large sizes.
